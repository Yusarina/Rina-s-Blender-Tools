# Rina-s-Blender-Tools Dev

## This is the dev version of the tool's this version could be unstable but may also have the latest fixes/ features!

Rina's Blender Tools is an set of tools to help shorten steps needed to optimize models into VRChat or other Games. Currently only does a few things but I planning to build even more features into these tools.

#### This will be an replacement to cats once it's more fleshed out, however at this minute of time, unless you only need the set features currently in I would recomend using the cats I currently maintain, see it [here](https://github.com/Yusarina/Cats-Blender-Plugin-Unofficial-).
